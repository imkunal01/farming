## Technical Architecture

AgriGlance employs a modular web architecture with:

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with responsive design
- **Backend**: PHP for server-side processing
- **Database**: MySQL for structured data storage
- **API Integration**: OpenWeatherMap API for weather data
- **Authentication**: Secure login system with password reset functionality
- **Local Storage**: For client-side data persistence
- **Email Service**: Brevo integration for transactional emails

The application follows a component-based structure, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability. Each module operates semi-independently while sharing core resources and user data.
