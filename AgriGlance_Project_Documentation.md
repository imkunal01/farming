## 15. Data Flow Architecture {#data-flow}

The data flow architecture illustrates how information moves through the system between components.

### Key Data Flows
1. **User Authentication Flow**
   - Client sends credentials to login.php
   - Server validates credentials against database
   - Session is created and token returned
   - Client stores session token
   - Authentication state maintained across pages
   - Token validated on subsequent requests
   - Session expiry handled gracefully

2. **Weather Data Flow**
   - User selects location on map
   - Client sends coordinates to get_weather.php
   - Server proxies request to OpenWeatherMap API
   - Weather data returned and parsed
   - Client displays processed weather information
   - Data cached for performance
   - Periodic refresh for real-time updates

3. **Crop Estimation Flow**
   - User submits crop data form
   - Client validates form data
   - Data sent to estimates.php
   - Server calculates yield estimates
   - Results stored in database
   - Estimation returned to client
   - Client displays results with visualizations
   - Option to save or share estimates

4. **Pest Report Flow**
   - User submits pest sighting form
   - Images uploaded to upload_pest_image.php
   - Report data sent to save_report.php
   - Server stores report in database
   - Report ID returned to client
   - Map and table views updated
   - Notification sent to nearby users (optional)
   - Analytics recalculated for new data

5. **Crop Plan Flow**
   - User creates or modifies crop plan
   - Plan data sent to save_plan.php
   - Server validates rotation rules
   - Plan stored in database
   - Confirmation returned to client
   - Calendar view updated
   - Resource calculations refreshed
   - Recommendations generated based on plan
